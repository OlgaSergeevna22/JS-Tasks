        <h1>Tomato</h1>
        <p>The tomato is the edible berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum, commonly known as a tomato plant. The species originated in western South America and Central America</p>
        <p>The Mexican Nahuatl word tomate gave rise to the Spanish word tomate, from which the English word tomato derived.Its domestication and use as a cultivated food may have originated with the indigenous peoples of Mexico. The Aztecs used tomatoes
            in their cooking at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for the first time after their contact with the Aztecs, they brought the plant to Europe, in a widespread transfer of plants
            known as the Columbian exchange. From there, the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized world during the 16th century.[</p>

        <h1>Potato</h1>
        <p>The potato is a starchy, tuberous crop from the perennial nightshade Solanum tuberosum. The word "potato" may refer either to the plant itself or to the edible tuber. In the Andes, where the species is indigenous, there are some other closely
            related cultivated potato species. </p>
        <p> Potatoes were introduced to Europe in the second half of the 16th century by the Spanish, and have since become an integral part of much of the world's food supply. It is the world's fourth-largest food crop, following maize, wheat, and rice.
            The green leaves and green skins of tubers exposed to the light are toxic.</p>
